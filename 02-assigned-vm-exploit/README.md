# Assignment 2 — Exploit the Assigned Vulnerable VM

## Scope
Black-box engagement against a provided vulnerable VM. Objectives: discover services, obtain **three** local footholds, and achieve **three** distinct privilege-escalation paths, documenting each with reproduction steps and fixes.

## What’s Inside
- **Report:** `VulnerableMachineExploitation.pdf` — full write-up with detailed documentation about the explotation steps.  

## Methods (High Level)
- **Enumeration:**
  - Service scan identified **SSH on a non-standard port**; web fuzzing revealed `upload.php` and an `uploads/` dir.
- **Local access (examples):**
  - FTP brute-force to recover a user credential; browsing revealed SUID helper + source.  
  - MySQL login via credential spray; dumped schema and recovered password hashes for offline cracking.  
  - Web upload → **reverse shell** through a generated PHP payload to `www-data`.
- **Privilege escalation (examples):**
  - **vsftpd 2.3.4 backdoor** exploit to root (legacy vuln used intentionally in lab).  
  - SUID helper leveraged to read restricted files (e.g., `/etc/shadow`) → crack → lateral move.  
  - `sudo` allowed `sed` without password; GTFOBins technique to modify `sudoers` and pivot to root.
- **Abuse of remote access:**
  - Demonstrated how a misused `sed` path could weaken `sshd_config` and expand SSH access.
