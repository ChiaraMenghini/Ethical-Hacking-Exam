# Assignment 2 — Exploit the Assigned Vulnerable VM

## Scope
Black-box engagement against a provided vulnerable VM. Objectives: discover services, obtain **three** local footholds, and achieve **three** distinct privilege-escalation paths, documenting each with reproduction steps and fixes.

## What’s Inside
- **Report:** `VulnerableMachineExploitation.pdf` — full write-up with detailed documentation about the explotation steps.  

## Methods (High Level)

### Local access
- **FTP credential brute-force** (Metasploit `scanner/ftp/ftp_login`) recovered `user1`; browsing the FTP tree revealed a SUID helper (`ppscat`) and its C source; additional users (`almostadmin`, `eth`) were identified. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
- **MySQL credential brute-force** (Metasploit `scanner/mysql/mysql_login`) authenticated as `eth`; a schema dump exposed `user1`’s hashed password, which was cracked with hashcat to obtain credentials. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
- **Web upload → reverse shell:** discovery of `upload.php` enabled a PHP web shell upload; a listener (`nc -nvlp 1234`) received a shell as `www-data`, then pivoted to `user1`. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

### Privilege escalation
- **Legacy service backdoor:** `vsftpd 2.3.4` exploited via Metasploit (`exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor`) for immediate root. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
- **SUID file abuse → credential recovery:** SUID `ppscat` read `/etc/shadow`; the `almostadmin` hash was cracked, enabling `su almostadmin`. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
- **`sudo` misconfiguration (GTFOBins):** `almostadmin` could run `/usr/bin/sed` as root without a password; used to edit `sudoers` and escalate to root (`sudo -i`). :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

> *Post-ex note:* `sed` was also used to relax `sshd_config` (commenting `DenyUsers`) to broaden SSH access for persistence. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
