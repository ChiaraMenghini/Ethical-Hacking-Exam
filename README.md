# Ethical Hacking Labs 2024 üß©üõ°Ô∏è

## Overview
Two team-based penetration-testing assignments from the Ethical Hacking course:
1) an intentionally vulnerable VM we designed to simulate real-world misconfigurations;  
2) a separate vulnerable VM assigned to our team, which we enumerated and exploited.

Each assignment followed the same structure: **3 local-access vulnerabilities** and **3 privilege-escalation paths**, with full documentation.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Notice
For educational/academic use only. All work was performed against **isolated lab VMs** we were explicitly authorized to test. Do **not** reuse techniques against systems you do not own or operate without *written* permission. The authors assume no responsibility for misuse.
